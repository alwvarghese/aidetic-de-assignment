#Approach Taken
The data pipeline was designed and implemented to ingest, process, and store streaming clickstream data from Kafka into a MySQL database. The primary steps involved in the approach are as follows:

Schema Definition:
A schema was defined for the JSON data to ensure proper parsing and structuring of the incoming data.

Data Ingestion:
Streaming data was read from a Kafka topic using Spark's readStream method, which allows for real-time data ingestion.

Data Conversion:
The Kafka message value, initially in binary format, was converted to a string format for further processing.

Data Parsing:
The JSON string was parsed into a structured DataFrame using the defined schema, making it easier to work with the data in a tabular format.

Batch Processing:
A function (process_batch) was defined to process each micro-batch of data. This function included:
Flattening nested JSON fields into a tabular format.
Calculating session duration (time spent) for each click.
Performing aggregations to calculate the number of clicks, number of unique users, and average time spent for each URL and country combination.
Writing the aggregated data to a MySQL database using JDBC.

Streaming Query:
The foreachBatch method was used to apply the batch processing function to each micro-batch of data, ensuring that the transformations and actions were applied to each micro-batch as it arrived.
The streaming query was started, and the code waited for a termination signal to stop the query.

#Assumptions Made
Several assumptions were made during the implementation of the data pipeline:

Databricks Environment:
Sparksession is not being created assuming it is a databricks environment. Hence, sparksession is not required.

Session Duration:
In the absence of a session_end column, it was assumed that each click represents a session. A fixed value (e.g., 5 minutes or 300 seconds) was used to approximate the session duration.

Data Completeness:
It was assumed that the incoming data from Kafka is complete and correctly formatted according to the defined schema.

Database Connectivity:
It was assumed that the MySQL database is accessible and the necessary JDBC driver is available in the Spark environment.

#Challenges Encountered

Several challenges were encountered during the implementation of the data pipeline:

Schema Definition:
Defining a comprehensive schema for nested JSON data was challenging, especially ensuring that all possible fields were accounted for.

Handling Missing session_end Column:
The absence of a session_end column required an alternative approach to calculate session duration. Using a fixed value for session duration is a simplification and may not accurately reflect actual user behavior.

Data Parsing and Transformation:
Parsing complex nested JSON data and flattening it into a tabular format required careful handling to ensure that all fields were correctly extracted and transformed.

Real-Time Processing:
Ensuring that the batch processing function could handle real-time data ingestion and processing without causing delays or bottlenecks was a critical challenge.

Database Write Performance:
Writing aggregated data to MySQL in real-time required optimizing the JDBC connection properties and ensuring that the database could handle the write load.
